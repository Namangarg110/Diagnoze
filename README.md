## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP - Used for the development of the webapp.\
PYTHON MODULES like keras, tensorflow, pandas â€“ For deep learning.

### Introduction
We at Diagnoze aim to provide quick results to the problems faced by our clients.Our webapp works on the principle of taking in info regarding the problem and giving instant results which guide them in taking further step towards treatment.Using this process,we have tried to reduce human errors on any ground.We mainly plan to develop a system where the complexity and computation time is low and accuracy is high.

### Working
Through this webapp and deep learning,we have aimed to detect different diseases. \
For example: \
**Tumor:-** We took Images of MRI Scan from the user as input and then using deep learning,we checked for the presence of tumors in the Image.Then according to the result,we have suggested the user to seek professional medical help.

**Diabetes:-** We have used regular health dataset with features like blood pressure,heart rate,age,gender,chest pain etc. to predict if the patient has diabetes or not.

**Heart Attack:-** Using regular health data,we predicted if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack.

**Corona Virus:-** Taking in the chest x-ray from the patient and considering the general health details,we tried to anticipate if the user has corona virus.
